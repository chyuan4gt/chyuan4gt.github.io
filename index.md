---

I am a **4th year** Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology. My supervisor is **Prof. Taesoo Kim**.

Before coming to Gatech, I got my Bachelor's degree from Nanjing University and Master's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I am honored to work at the Institute of Parallel and Distributed System (IPADS) under **Prof. Haibo Chen**'s supervision during my master's study, and I had an unforgettable experience with my teachers and labmates there.

# Research Interests

My research focuses on **operating systems' security and reliability issues**, and **optimizing operating system performance**. 
More specifically, I use multiple methods including static analysis and fuzzing to detect vulnerabilities in OS.
Recently, I start looking into the performance problems of systems.
