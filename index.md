title: About Me
---

I am a **5th year** Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by myself (lol).

Before coming to Gatech, I got my Bachelor's degree from Nanjing University and my Master's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I am honored to work at the Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS) under **Prof. Haibo Chen**'s supervision during my master's study, and I had an unforgettable experience with my teachers and labmates there.

# Research Interests

My research interests focus on building system infrastructures for Large Language Models.
Specifically, my ongoing projects involve optimizing the performance of LLM inference systems.
Before, I also studied bug detection in hypervisors and the Linux kernel by static analysis and fuzzing.
